        <p align="center">
       - database management system is collection of software or programs which helps 
         user in creation and maintenanceof a database it is also known as computerized 
         record-keeping system.
       - dbms is software system that helps in the process of defining,constructing,
         manipulating the database.
       - computer-based information system (IS)is capable of serving many complex task
         in coordinated manner.such system handle large volume of data, multiple users 
         and serveral applications in centrilized database environment.
         the heart of an information system (IS) is database management system. this is 
         because maost IS have to handle hugs amounts of data.this core modulof an 
         information system is also known as database management system(DBMS)
         database management system has become an integral part of information system 
         of many orginazations as it ts use to handle the data</p><hr>

         <h2><bq>Introduction</bq></h2>
          a description of data in terms of data model is called a schema.
          the description of a database is calles database <b>schema</b>which 
          is a specify during database design and it does not except to change 
          frequently.<hr><hr>
          <h1><B>NORMALIZATION PROCESS</B></h1>
          Normalization is a step by step decomposition of complex records Into 
          simple records.
          Normalization is a process of organizing data in database in more efficient
          form. it results in tables that satisfy some constraints and are represented
          in a simple manner. this process is also called as canonical synthesis.
          <defination>Normalization is a process of designing a consistent database
          by minimizing redundancy and ensuring data integrity through decomposition 
          which is lossless.

        <b><i>java is a very popular and used as distributed language for creating application 
            on networks because of its ability to share both data and programs.java is verysimple 
            langusge which has many features of c and c++that are redundant or sources of unrelible
            code are not part of java for example,it does not use pointers, pre-processor header 
            files,goto statement and many othersjava language also eliminates operator overloading
            multiple inheritance. java is a more robust language than others as it has two times 
            execution strategy that is compliation and interpretion,therefore provide reliability
            garbage-collection is one of the featuers of java language, which reduces programmers 
            task of memory management.ava provides exception handling, which catches the server
            errors and reduces risk of crashing the system java is secure programing language which
            are used for programming on internet should provide the security as the hazard of viruses
            and exploitation of resources are everywhere. jva programming system verifies all memory
            access and ensures that viruses cannot comunicate with an applet the absence of pointers
            in java leads to proper memory access.java supports multithread and interactive means
            handling multiple tasks concurrently or simultaneousaly by supporting multithreaded
            programs this means that there is no need to wait for application to complete one task
            before beginning another. therefore improving the interactive performance in graphics
            application the java runtime or JDK comes with tools that support multi-processes
            synchronization and construct smoothly running intractive systems.java performance is
            very remarkable for an interprated language, mainly due to to the use of intermediate 
            code calledbyte code. the inclusion of multithreading enhance theexecution speed of java 
            programs. java is also dynamic language with the capacity of dynamically linking in new 
            class labraries, methods and objects. java can also determine the type of class with the 
            help of query, making it possible to either dynamically link or abort the program, depending
            on the response. java communicates with web page through a special tag called applet as a 
            special program that is transmitted over the network or internet. it automatically  gets 
            executed by java - compatible web browser. an applet is downloaded as per user rquirement
            an applet is said  to an "intelligent program" because the applet tends to react to the the
            user input and changes its states dynamically. working with applet is very interesting. java
            takes care of major issues related with security and portability of any profram code over 
            internet. the evoulation of internet helped to make a java as leading programming language.
            over the network there are two categories  of objects that are transmitted between the server 
            and client computers: 
            1] active objects :- a self executing program is dynamic data. this data is called as active 
            agent on the client computer.
            2] passive objects :- these objects are in the form of information and active programs. when
            an email is view it is viewing the passive data. a downloaded program until it is executed is 
            called as passive data. 
            these dynamic network programs create problems in terms of security and portability. java 
            effectively handels these problems. introducing a new form of program known as applet.
            java is truly object-oriented language. almost everything in java is an object. all program 
            code and data reside within objects and classes. java comes with an extensive set of classes, 
            arranged in packages that can be used in programs by inheritance. the object model in java 
            is simple and easy to extend.
            Arrays : an array is a collection of homogeneous or contiguous or related data items that shares 
            a common name.
            array provides a convenient means of grouping related information. writing a number called index
            can access individual array element or subscript in brackts after the array name 
            1]one-dimensional arrays: when a list of items are given in one variable name using only one subscript
            and such a variable is called a single-subscripted variable or a non-dimensional array 
            array starts with 0th location.array can be created as any other normal variable. so like other 
            variables arrays must be declared and created in computer memory before they are used.
            in java all arrays are dynamically allocated creation of an array involves three steps 
            i> declaring the array
            ii> creating memory location for array elements 
            iii> putting values into the memory locations of array elements 
            2]two dimensional array can be used for processing table of values.the table is nothing but matrix 
            consisting of rows and columns.
            the rows and columns can be represented by using subscripts
            vectors in java ;- vector is an extinsible array.it is similar to an array in that it holds multiple
            objects can be retrived using an index value an array is data type for collecting a fixed number of
            data type the vector class provides "arrays" of variable sizes.
            the main difference is that vector automatically grows when they run out of allocated space they also
            provides extra methods for adding and removing elements which which is not there in case of arrays the 
            vector class is an example of what is called a container.
